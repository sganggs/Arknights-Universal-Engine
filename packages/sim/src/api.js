 * say whether its operator may attack (canAttack) and what an attack turn without a target does (store); 5: a trait
 * behaviour may say which enemies its operator does not select (skip), a skill behaviour the running skill's range
 * (range); 6: a trait behaviour may say which allies its operator heals through their 禁疗 (healThrough).
